The map argument corresponds to the sourcemap object. The line and column offset are optional parameters used for offsetting the generated line and column. (this can be used when post-processing or wrapping the code linked to the sourcemap, in Parcel this is used when combining maps).\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```JS\\nimport SourceMap from \'@parcel/source-map\';\\n\\nconst RAW_SOURCEMAP = {\\n  version: 3,\\n  file: \\"helloworld.js\\",\\n  sources: [\\"helloworld.coffee\\"],\\n  names: [],\\n  mappings: \\"AAAA;AAAA,EAAA,OAAO,CAAC,GAAR,CAAY,aAAZ,CAAA,CAAA;AAAA\\",\\n};\\n\\nlet sourcemap = new SourceMap();\\nsourcemap.addVLQMap(RAW_SOURCEMAP);\\n\\n// This function removes the underlying references in the native code\\nsourcemap.delete();\\n```\\n\\n#### Creating a sourcemap one mapping at a time\\n\\nIf you want to use this library to create a sourcemap from scratch you can, for this you can call the `addIndexedMapping(mapping, lineOffset, columnOffset)` function.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```JS\\nimport SourceMap from \'@parcel/source-map\';\\n\\nlet sourcemap = new SourceMap();\\n\\n// Add a single mapping\\nsourcemap.addIndexedMapping({\\n  generated: {\\n    // line index starts at 1\\n    line: 1,\\n    // column index starts at 0\\n    column: 4\\n  },\\n  original: {\\n    // line index starts at 1\\n    line: 1,\\n    // column index starts at 0\\n    column: 4\\n  },\\n  source: \'index.js\',\\n  // Name is optional\\n  name: \'A\'\\n});\\n\\n// This function removes the underlying references in the native code\\nsourcemap.delete();\\n```\\n\\n### Caching\\n\\nFor caching sourcemaps we have a `toBuffer()` function which returns a buffer that can be saved on disk for later use and combining sourcemaps very quickly.\\n\\nYou can add a cached map to a SourceMap instance using the `addBuffer(buffer, lineOffset)` function, where you can also offset the generated line and column.\\n\\n## Inspiration and purpose\\n\\n### Why did we write this library\\n\\nParcel is a performance conscious bundler, and therefore we like to optimise Parcel\'s performance as much as possible.\\n\\nOur original source-map implementation used mozilla\'s source-map and a bunch of javascript and had issues with memory usage and serialization times (we were keeping all mappings in memory using JS objects and write/read it using JSON for caching).\\n\\nThis implementation has been written from scratch in Rust minimizing the memory usage, by utilizing indexes for sources and names and optimizing serialization times by using Buffers instead of JSON for caching.\\n\\n### Previous works and inspiration\\n\\nWithout these libraries this library wouldn\'t be as good as it is today. We\'ve inspired and optimized our code using ideas and patterns used inside these libraries as well as used it to figure out how sourcemaps should be handled properly.\\n\\n- [source-map by Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map)\\n- [source-map-mappings by Nick Fitzgerald](https://github.com/fitzgen/source-map-mappings)\\n- [sourcemap-codec by Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sourcemap-codec)\\n\\n## Contributing to this library\\n\\nAll contributions to this library are welcome as is with any part of Parcel\'s vast collection of libraries and tools.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo be able to build and work on this project you need to have the following tools installed:\\n\\n- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/)\\n- [`Rust`](https://rustup.rs/)\\n\\n### Building the project\\n\\nFor development purposes you might want to build or rebuild the project, for this you need to build the N-API module and JS Code.\\n\\nTo do this run the following commands: (for more information about this you can have a look in `./package.json` and `./Makefile`)\\n\\n```shell\\nyarn transpile && yarn build:node\\n```\\n\\n### Tagging a release\\n\\nBefore you\'re able to tag a release ensure to have cargo-release installed `cargo install cargo-release`, we use it to tag the cargo files with a release tag.\\n\\n```shell\\nyarn tag-release <version>\\n```","name":"@parcel/source-map","version":"2.1.1","publisher":""},"@parcel/transformer-babel@2.8.3":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel","path":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/@parcel/transformer-babel","licenseFile":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/@parcel/transformer-babel/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2017-present Devon Govett\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\\n==========================\\n\\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python\'s\\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\\n\\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\\nsoftware.\\n\\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\\n\\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\\nthe various releases.\\n\\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don\'t.\\n\\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\\n    CNRI, however, Stallman\'s lawyer has told CNRI\'s lawyer that 1.6.1\\n    is \\"not incompatible\\" with the GPL.\\n\\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido\'s\\ndirection to make these releases possible.\\n\\n\\nB.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\\n          form), You must:\\n\\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\\n               with the Licensed Material:\\n\\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\\n                    designated);\\n\\n                ii. a copyright notice;\\n\\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\\n\\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\\n                    warranties;\\n\\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\\n\\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\\n\\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\\n\\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n          information.\\n\\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n          reasonably practicable.\\n\\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\'s\\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\\n     portion of the contents of the database;\\n\\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\\n\\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\\n\\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\\n\\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.

When given a list\\nof glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file\\nlist, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,\\na FileList holds the pattern for latter use.\\n\\nThis allows you to define a FileList to match any number of\\nfiles, but only search out the actual files when then FileList\\nitself is actually used. The key is that the first time an\\nelement of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns\\nare resolved into a real list of file names.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nAdd files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob\\npatterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array\\nmethods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to\\nan actual list of files.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar fl = new FileList();\\nfl.include(\'test/*.js\');\\nfl.exclude(\'test/helpers.js\');\\n```\\n\\nUse the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this\\nwhen your inclusions are too broad.\\n\\n### Array methods\\n\\nFileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array\\nmethods, including the following:\\n\\n* join\\n* pop\\n* push\\n* concat\\n* reverse\\n* shift\\n* unshift\\n* slice\\n* splice\\n* sort\\n* filter\\n* forEach\\n* some\\n* every\\n* map\\n* indexOf\\n* lastIndexOf\\n* reduce\\n* reduceRight\\n\\nWhen you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList\\nwill be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will\\nbe invoked on that result.\\n\\n### Special `length` method\\n\\n`length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a\\nproperty) which returns the number of actual files in the list\\nonce it\'s been resolved.\\n\\n### FileList-specific methods\\n\\n`include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list\\n\\n`exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex\\n\\n`resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of\\nfiles. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array\\nmethods is called.\\n\\n`toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an\\nactual array of filepaths.\\n\\n`clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used\\nbefore resolving the list.\\n\\n`clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules.","name":"filelist","version":"1.0.4"},"fill-range@7.0.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fill-range","publisher":"Jon Schlinkert","path":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/fill-range","licenseFile":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/fill-range/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014-present, Jon Schlinkert.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\\n\\n```html\\n<script type=\\"text/javascript\\" src=\\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\\"><\/script>\\n<script>\\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\\n<\/script>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install imurmurhash\\n```\\n\\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\\n\\n```javascript\\nMurmurHash3 = require(\'imurmurhash\');\\n```\\n\\nQuick Example\\n-------------\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Create the initial hash\\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3(\'string\');\\n\\n// Incrementally add text\\nhashState.hash(\'more strings\');\\nhashState.hash(\'even more strings\');\\n\\n// All calls can be chained if desired\\nhashState.hash(\'and\').hash(\'some\').hash(\'more\');\\n\\n// Get a result\\nhashState.result();\\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\\n```\\n\\nFunctions\\n---------\\n\\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\\n...\\n\\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\\n```\\n\\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Do the whole string at once\\nMurmurHash3(\'this is a test string\').result();\\n// 0x70529328\\n\\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\\nvar m = MurmurHash3(\'this is a\');\\nm.result();\\n// 0xbfc4f834\\nm.hash(\' test string\').result();\\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLicense (MIT)\\n-------------\\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal in\\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\\nsubject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\\r\\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the\\r\\nfollowing:\\r\\n\\r\\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\\r\\n\\r\\nb) to prepare derivative works (\\"Derivative Works\\") based upon the Original\\r\\nWork;\\r\\n\\r\\nc) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the\\r\\npublic;\\r\\n\\r\\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\\r\\n\\r\\ne) to display the Original Work publicly.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Grant of Patent License.

The term \\"Source Code\\" means the preferred\\r\\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\\r\\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\\r\\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\\r\\nWork along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\\r\\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\\r\\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\\r\\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\\r\\nlong as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\\r\\nthe address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\\r\\nthe copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\\r\\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\\r\\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\\r\\nOriginal Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\\r\\nin this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\\r\\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\\r\\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\\r\\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\\r\\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\\r\\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work.

You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\\r\\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\\r\\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\\r\\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \\"Attribution Notice.\\" You must cause\\r\\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\\r\\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\\r\\nmodified the Original Work.\\r\\n\\r\\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.

This limitation of liability shall not\\r\\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor\'s\\r\\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\\r\\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\\r\\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\\r\\n\\r\\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\\r\\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\\r\\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\\r\\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\\r\\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\\r\\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\\r\\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\\r\\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\\r\\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\\r\\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\\r\\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\\r\\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\\r\\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\\r\\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\\r\\npatent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\\r\\npatent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\\r\\nhardware.\\r\\n\\r\\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\\r\\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\\r\\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\\r\\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\\r\\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\\r\\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\\r\\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\\r\\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\\r\\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\\r\\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\\r\\n\\r\\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\\r\\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\\r\\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\\r\\nattorneys\' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\\r\\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\\r\\nLicense.\\r\\n\\r\\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\\r\\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\\r\\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\\r\\nmake it enforceable.\\r\\n\\r\\n14) Definition of \\"You\\" in This License. \\"You\\" throughout this License, whether\\r\\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\\r\\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\\r\\nentities, \\"You\\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\\r\\nunder common control with you.

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\\n\\n- Isn\'t bloated\\n- Has a simple Promise based API\\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\\n- Supports namespaces\\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won\'t kill your app)\\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nInstall Keyv.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --save keyv\\n```\\n\\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\\n```\\n\\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\n\\n// One of the following\\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'etcd://localhost:2379\');\\n\\n// Handle DB connection errors\\nkeyv.on(\'error\', err => console.log(\'Connection Error\', err));\\n\\nawait keyv.set(\'foo\', \'expires in 1 second\', 1000); // true\\nawait keyv.set(\'foo\', \'never expires\'); // true\\nawait keyv.get(\'foo\'); // \'never expires\'\\nawait keyv.delete(\'foo\'); // true\\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\\n```\\n\\n### Namespaces\\n\\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\\n\\n```js\\nconst users = new Keyv(\'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379\', { namespace: \'users\' });\\nconst cache = new Keyv(\'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379\', { namespace: \'cache\' });\\n\\nawait users.set(\'foo\', \'users\'); // true\\nawait cache.set(\'foo\', \'cache\'); // true\\nawait users.get(\'foo\'); // \'users\'\\nawait cache.get(\'foo\'); // \'cache\'\\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\\nawait users.get(\'foo\'); // undefined\\nawait cache.get(\'foo\'); // \'cache\'\\n```\\n\\n### Custom Serializers\\n\\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\\n\\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\\n\\n```js\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\\n```\\n\\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\\n\\n## Official Storage Adapters\\n\\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\\n\\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\\n---|---|---\\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \\nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \\nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \\nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \\nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\\n\\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\\n\\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\nconst myAdapter = require(\'./my-storage-adapter\');\\n\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\\n```\\n\\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\\n\\n```js\\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\\n```\\n\\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\nconst QuickLRU = require(\'quick-lru\');\\n\\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\\n```\\n\\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\\n\\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \\"Least Recently Used\\" (LRU) cache\\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\\n\\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\\n\\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\\n\\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\\n\\nInside your module:\\n\\n```js\\nclass AwesomeModule {\\n\\tconstructor(opts) {\\n\\t\\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\\n\\t\\t\\turi: typeof opts.cache === \'string\' && opts.cache,\\n\\t\\t\\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== \'string\' && opts.cache,\\n\\t\\t\\tnamespace: \'awesome-module\'\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow it can be consumed like this:\\n\\n```js\\nconst AwesomeModule = require(\'awesome-module\');\\n\\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\\n\\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: \'redis://localhost\' });\\n\\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\\n```\\n\\n## Compression\\n\\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\\n\\n```js\\nconst KeyvGzip = require(\'@keyv/compress-gzip\');\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\n\\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\\n```\\n\\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\\n\\n### Want to build your own? \\n\\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\\n\\n```typescript\\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\\n\\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\\n\\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\\n\\tasync serialize(value: any);\\n\\tasync deserialize(value: any);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\\n\\n```js\\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require(\'@keyv/test-suite\');\\nconst KeyvGzip = require(\'@keyv/compress-gzip\');\\n\\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\\n```\\n\\n## API\\n\\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\\n\\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\\n\\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `\'error\'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\\n\\n### uri\\n\\nType: `String`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nThe connection string URI.\\n\\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\\n\\n### options\\n\\nType: `Object`\\n\\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\\n\\n#### options.namespace\\n\\nType: `String`<br>\\nDefault: `\'keyv\'`\\n\\nNamespace for the current instance.\\n\\n#### options.ttl\\n\\nType: `Number`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\\n\\n#### options.compression\\n\\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\\n\\n#### options.serialize\\n\\nType: `Function`<br>\\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\\n\\nA custom serialization function.\\n\\n#### options.deserialize\\n\\nType: `Function`<br>\\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\\n\\nA custom deserialization function.\\n\\n#### options.store\\n\\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\\nDefault: `new Map()`\\n\\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\\n\\n#### options.adapter\\n\\nType: `String`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `\'redis\'` or `\'mongodb\'`.\\n\\n### Instance\\n\\nKeys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.\\n\\n#### .set(key, value, [ttl])\\n\\nSet a value.\\n\\nBy default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.\\n\\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true`.\\n\\n#### .get(key, [options])\\n\\nReturns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.\\n\\n##### options.raw\\n\\nType: `Boolean`<br>\\nDefault: `false`\\n\\nIf set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.\\n\\nThis contains the TTL timestamp.\\n\\n#### .delete(key)\\n\\nDeletes an entry.\\n\\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.\\n\\n#### .clear()\\n\\nDelete all entries in the current namespace.\\n\\nReturns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.\\n\\n#### .iterator()\\n\\nIterate over all entries of the current namespace.\\n\\nReturns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:\\n\\n```js\\n// please note that the \\"await\\" keyword should be used here\\nfor await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {\\n  console.log(key, value);\\n};\\n```\\n\\n# How to Contribute\\n\\nIn this section of the documentation we will cover:\\n\\n1) How to set up this repository locally\\n2) How to get started with running commands\\n3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\nThis package requires the following dependencies to run:\\n\\n1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\\n3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\\n\\n## Setting up your workspace\\n\\nTo contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:\\n\\n1) Fork this repository into your Git account\\n2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`\\n3) Install any of the above missing dependencies\\n\\n## Launching the project\\n\\nOnce the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:\\n\\n1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.\\n2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.\\n3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.\\n4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project\'s Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.\\n\\n## Available Commands\\n\\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\\n\\nHere, we\'ll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn`\\n\\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn bootstrap`\\n\\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn test:services:start`\\n\\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project\'s Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\\n\\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\\n\\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project\'s Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\\n\\n### `yarn test`\\n\\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn clean`\\n\\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\\n\\n## Contributing Changes\\n\\nNow that you\'ve set up your workspace, you\'re ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\\n\\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project\'s tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\\n\\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT © Jared Wray","name":"keyv","version":"4.5.2"},"kind-of@6.0.3":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/kind-of","publisher":"Jon Schlinkert","path":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/kind-of","licenseFile":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/kind-of/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017, Jon Schlinkert.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You may not\\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients\' rights in the Source Code\\nForm.\\n\\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\\n\\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\\n\\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\\nForm, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\\nthe Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\\nForm by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\\nthan the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\\n\\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\\nLicense, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\\nlicense for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\\nthe recipients\' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\\n\\n3.3.

If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\\nLicense(s).\\n\\n3.4. Notices\\n\\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\\n\\n3.5.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\\nYour receipt of the notice.\\n\\n5.2.

This *\\n* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *\\n* personal injury resulting from such party\'s negligence to the *\\n* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *\\n* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *\\n* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *\\n* limitation may not apply to You. *\\n* *\\n************************************************************************\\n\\n8. Litigation\\n-------------\\n\\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party\'s ability to bring\\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\\n\\n9. Miscellaneous\\n----------------\\n\\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\nto, the following:\\n\\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n  and translate a Work;\\n\\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n\\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\'s image or likeness\\n  depicted in a Work;\\n\\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\\n\\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n  a Work;\\n\\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n\\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\\n\\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\'s Copyright\\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \\"Waiver\\"). Affirmer makes\\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\\ndetriment of Affirmer\'s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\\nAffirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer\'s Copyright and Related Rights in\\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\\npromotional purposes (the \\"License\\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\\nAffirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\\n\\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\\n\\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\\n\\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\\n  any person\'s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\\n\\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\\n\\nFor more information, please see\\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>","name":"mdn-data","version":"2.0.30"},"media-typer@1.1.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jshttp/media-typer","publisher":"Douglas Christopher Wilson","email":"doug@somethingdoug.com","path":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/media-typer","licenseFile":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/media-typer/LICENSE","licenseText":"(The MIT License)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017 Douglas Christopher Wilson\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2014-2017 Douglas Christopher Wilson","name":"media-typer","version":"1.1.0"},"meow@7.1.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow","publisher":"Sindre Sorhus","email":"sindresorhus@gmail.com","path":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/meow","licenseFile":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/meow/license","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) Sindre Sorhus <sindresorhus@gmail.com> (https://sindresorhus.com)\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It uses LRU/LFU (LRFU) expiration to retain referenced data, and then once data has been inactive, it uses weak references (and finalization registry) to allow GC to remove the cached data as part of the normal GC cycles, but still continue to provide cached access to the data as long as it still resides in memory and hasn\'t been collected. This provides the best of modern expiration strategies combined with optimal GC interaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a typical GC\'ed VM, objects may continue to exist in memory long after they are no longer (strongly) referenced, but using a weak-referencing cached, we allow the GC to collect such data, but the cache can return this data up until the point it is garbaged collected, ensuring much more efficient use of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can also be used to ensure a single object identity per key. By storing an object in the cache for a given key, we can check the cache whenever we need that object, and before recreating it, thereby giving us the means to ensure we also use the same object for a given key as long as it still exists in memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project is tested and run NodeJS and Deno (requires NodeJS v14.10 or higher or Node v13.0 with --harmony-weak-ref flag).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Setup\\r\\n\\r\\nInstall with (NPM):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nnpm i weak-lru-cache\\r\\n```\\r\\nAnd `import` or `require` it to access the constructor:\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport { WeakLRUCache } from \'weak-lru-cache\';\\r\\n\\r\\nlet myCache = new WeakLRUCache();\\r\\nmyValue.setValue(\'key\', { greeting: \'hello world\' });\\r\\nmyValue.getValue(\'key\') -> return the object above as long as it is still cached\\r\\n```\\r\\nOr in Deno, import directly from the [`weakcache` deno.land package](https://deno.land/x/weakcache):\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport { WeakLRUCache } from \'https://deno.land/x/weakcache/index.js\';\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WeakLRUCache` class extends the native `Map` class and also includes the following methods, which are the primary intended interactions with the cache:\\r\\n\\r\\n### getValue(key)\\r\\nGets the value referenced by the given key and returns it. If the value is no longer cached, will return undefined. \\r\\n\\r\\n### setValue(key, value, expirationPriority?)\\r\\nSets or inserts the value into the cache, with the given key. This will create a new cache entry to reference your provided value. This also returns the cache entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `key` can be any JS value.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the `value` is an object, it will be stored in the cache, until it expires (as determined by the LRFU expiration policy), *and* is garbage collected. If you provide a primitive value (string, number, boolean, null, etc.), this can not be weakly referenced, so the value will still be stored in the LRFU cache, but once it expires, it will immediately be removed, rather than waiting for GC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `expirationPriority` is an optional directive indicating how quickly the cache entry should expire. A higher value will indicate the entry should expire sooner. This can be used to help limit the amount of memory used by cache if you are loading large objects. Using the default cache size, and entries with varied expirationPriority values, the expiration cache will typically hold a sum of about 100,000 of the expirationPriority values. This means that if you wanted to have a cache to stay around or under 100MB, you could provide the size, divided by 1000 (or using `>> 10` is much faster), as the expirationPriority:\\r\\n```\\r\\nmyCache.setValue(\'key\', bigObject, sizeOfObject >> 10);\\r\\n```\\r\\nThe `expirationPriority` can also be set to `-1` that the value should be `pinned` in memory and never expire, until the entry has been changed (with a positive `expirationPriority`).\\r\\n\\r\\n## `WeakLRUCache(options)` Constructor\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WeakLRUCache` constructor supports an optional `options` object parameter that allows specific configuration and cache tuning. The following properties (all optional) can be defined on the `options` object:\\r\\n\\r\\n### cacheSize\\r\\nThis indicates the number of entries to allocate in the cache. This defaults to 32,768, and the maximum allowed value is 16,777,216.\\r\\n\\r\\n### expirer\\r\\nBy default there is a single shared expiration cache, that is a single instance of `LRFUExpirer`. However, you can define your own expiration cache or create separate instances of LRFUExpirer. Generally using a (the default) single instance is preferable since it naturally gives higher priority/recency to more heavily used caches, and allows lesser used caches to expire more of their entries.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also set this to `false` to indicate that no LRU/LRFU cache should be used and the cache should rely entirely on weak-references.\\r\\n\\r\\n### deferRegister\\r\\nThis flag can be set to true to save key and cache information so that it can defer the finalization registration. This tends to be slightly faster for caches that are more heavily dominated by lots of entry replacements (multiple setValue calls to same entries before they expire). However, for (what is generally considered more typical) usage more dominated by setting values and getting them until they expire, the default setting will probably be faster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Using Cache Entries\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WeakLRUCache` class extends the native `Map` class, and consequently, all the standard Map methods are available. As a Map, all the values are cache entries, which are typically `WeakRef` objects that hold a reference to the cached value, along with retention information. This means that the `get(key)` differs from `getValue(key)` in that it returns the cache entry, which references the value, rather than the value itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cache entries also can contain metadata about the entry, including information about the cache entries position in the LRFU cache that informs when it will expire. However, you can also set your own properties on the cache entry to store you own metadata. This will be retained until the entry is removed/collected.\\r\\n\\r\\n## License\\r\\n\\r\\nMIT","name":"weak-lru-cache","version":"1.2.2"},"webidl-conversions@4.0.2":{"licenses":"BSD-2-Clause","repository":"https://github.com/jsdom/webidl-conversions","publisher":"Domenic Denicola","email":"d@domenic.me","path":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/webidl-conversions","licenseFile":"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/webidl-conversions/LICENSE.md","licenseText":"# The BSD 2-Clause License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014, Domenic Denicola\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\\n\\n1.
