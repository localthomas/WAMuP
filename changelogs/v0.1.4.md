# Improved Image Loading in Albums Tab

Improved the loading speed for the thumbnails of the "Albums" tab.
The first time the tab is opened, the images are loaded in and all subsequent loading procedures use cached values for the thumbnails instead.
This reduces layout shifts and visual pop-in when opening the tab again.
