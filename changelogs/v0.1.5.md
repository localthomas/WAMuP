# Switched to `webkitdirectory` for Folder Selection

Instead of using the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API), this version uses the more common [`webkitdirectory`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/webkitdirectory) attribute on an input element.
This adds compatibility with other browser engines, although only Firefox was tested briefly.
