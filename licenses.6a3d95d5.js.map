Litigation\\n-------------\\n\\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\\n\\n9.

The map argument corresponds to the sourcemap object. The line and column offset are optional parameters used for offsetting the generated line and column. (this can be used when post-processing or wrapping the code linked to the sourcemap, in Parcel this is used when combining maps).\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```JS\\nimport SourceMap from '@parcel/source-map';\\n\\nconst RAW_SOURCEMAP = {\\n  version: 3,\\n  file: \\\"helloworld.js\\\",\\n  sources: [\\\"helloworld.coffee\\\"],\\n  names: [],\\n  mappings: \\\"AAAA;AAAA,EAAA,OAAO,CAAC,GAAR,CAAY,aAAZ,CAAA,CAAA;AAAA\\\",\\n};\\n\\nlet sourcemap = new SourceMap();\\nsourcemap.addVLQMap(RAW_SOURCEMAP);\\n\\n// This function removes the underlying references in the native code\\nsourcemap.delete();\\n```\\n\\n#### Creating a sourcemap one mapping at a time\\n\\nIf you want to use this library to create a sourcemap from scratch you can, for this you can call the `addIndexedMapping(mapping, lineOffset, columnOffset)` function.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```JS\\nimport SourceMap from '@parcel/source-map';\\n\\nlet sourcemap = new SourceMap();\\n\\n// Add a single mapping\\nsourcemap.addIndexedMapping({\\n  generated: {\\n    // line index starts at 1\\n    line: 1,\\n    // column index starts at 0\\n    column: 4\\n  },\\n  original: {\\n    // line index starts at 1\\n    line: 1,\\n    // column index starts at 0\\n    column: 4\\n  },\\n  source: 'index.js',\\n  // Name is optional\\n  name: 'A'\\n});\\n\\n// This function removes the underlying references in the native code\\nsourcemap.delete();\\n```\\n\\n### Caching\\n\\nFor caching sourcemaps we have a `toBuffer()` function which returns a buffer that can be saved on disk for later use and combining sourcemaps very quickly.\\n\\nYou can add a cached map to a SourceMap instance using the `addBuffer(buffer, lineOffset)` function, where you can also offset the generated line and column.\\n\\n## Inspiration and purpose\\n\\n### Why did we write this library\\n\\nParcel is a performance conscious bundler, and therefore we like to optimise Parcel's performance as much as possible.\\n\\nOur original source-map implementation used mozilla's source-map and a bunch of javascript and had issues with memory usage and serialization times (we were keeping all mappings in memory using JS objects and write/read it using JSON for caching).\\n\\nThis implementation has been written from scratch in Rust minimizing the memory usage, by utilizing indexes for sources and names and optimizing serialization times by using Buffers instead of JSON for caching.\\n\\n### Previous works and inspiration\\n\\nWithout these libraries this library wouldn't be as good as it is today. We've inspired and optimized our code using ideas and patterns used inside these libraries as well as used it to figure out how sourcemaps should be handled properly.\\n\\n- [source-map by Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map)\\n- [source-map-mappings by Nick Fitzgerald](https://github.com/fitzgen/source-map-mappings)\\n- [sourcemap-codec by Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sourcemap-codec)\\n\\n## Contributing to this library\\n\\nAll contributions to this library are welcome as is with any part of Parcel's vast collection of libraries and tools.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo be able to build and work on this project you need to have the following tools installed:\\n\\n- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/)\\n- [`Rust`](https://rustup.rs/)\\n\\n### Building the project\\n\\nFor development purposes you might want to build or rebuild the project, for this you need to build the N-API module and JS Code.\\n\\nTo do this run the following commands: (for more information about this you can have a look in `./package.json` and `./Makefile`)\\n\\n```shell\\nyarn transpile && yarn build:node\\n```\\n\\n### Tagging a release\\n\\nBefore you're able to tag a release ensure to have cargo-release installed `cargo install cargo-release`, we use it to tag the cargo files with a release tag.\\n\\n```shell\\nyarn tag-release <version>\\n```\",\n        \"name\": \"@parcel/source-map\",\n        \"version\": \"2.0.2\",\n        \"publisher\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"@parcel/transformer-babel@2.4.0\": {\n        \"licenses\": \"MIT\",\n        \"repository\": \"https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel\",\n        \"path\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/@parcel/transformer-babel\",\n        \"licenseFile\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/@parcel/transformer-babel/LICENSE\",\n        \"licenseText\": \"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2017-present Devon Govett\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Our\\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\\n     agreements.\\n\\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\\n\\n  f.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\\n     under this Public License.\\n\\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\\n     individually chosen by them.\\n\\n  j.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\\n          6(a).\\n\\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.

For purposes of this Public License,\\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\\n\\n       5. Downstream recipients.\\n\\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\\n               Public License.\\n\\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\\n               Material.\\n\\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\\n\\n  b. Other rights.\\n\\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\\n\\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\\n          Public License.\\n\\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\\n\\n\\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\\n\\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\\nfollowing conditions.\\n\\n  a. Attribution.\\n\\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\\n          form), You must:\\n\\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\\n               with the Licensed Material:\\n\\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\\n                    designated);\\n\\n                ii. a copyright notice;\\n\\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\\n\\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\\n                    warranties;\\n\\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\\n\\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\\n\\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\\n\\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n          information.\\n\\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n          reasonably practicable.\\n\\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\\n     portion of the contents of the database;\\n\\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\\n\\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\\n\\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\\n\\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.

It's also much smaller.

When given a list\\nof glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file\\nlist, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,\\na FileList holds the pattern for latter use.\\n\\nThis allows you to define a FileList to match any number of\\nfiles, but only search out the actual files when then FileList\\nitself is actually used. The key is that the first time an\\nelement of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns\\nare resolved into a real list of file names.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nAdd files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob\\npatterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array\\nmethods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to\\nan actual list of files.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar fl = new FileList();\\nfl.include('test/*.js');\\nfl.exclude('test/helpers.js');\\n```\\n\\nUse the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this\\nwhen your inclusions are too broad.\\n\\n### Array methods\\n\\nFileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array\\nmethods, including the following:\\n\\n* join\\n* pop\\n* push\\n* concat\\n* reverse\\n* shift\\n* unshift\\n* slice\\n* splice\\n* sort\\n* filter\\n* forEach\\n* some\\n* every\\n* map\\n* indexOf\\n* lastIndexOf\\n* reduce\\n* reduceRight\\n\\nWhen you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList\\nwill be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will\\nbe invoked on that result.\\n\\n### Special `length` method\\n\\n`length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a\\nproperty) which returns the number of actual files in the list\\nonce it's been resolved.\\n\\n### FileList-specific methods\\n\\n`include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list\\n\\n`exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex\\n\\n`resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of\\nfiles. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array\\nmethods is called.\\n\\n`toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an\\nactual array of filepaths.\\n\\n`clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used\\nbefore resolving the list.\\n\\n`clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules.\",\n        \"name\": \"filelist\",\n        \"version\": \"1.0.3\"\n    },\n    \"fill-range@7.0.1\": {\n        \"licenses\": \"MIT\",\n        \"repository\": \"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fill-range\",\n        \"publisher\": \"Jon Schlinkert\",\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/jonschlinkert\",\n        \"path\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/fill-range\",\n        \"licenseFile\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/fill-range/LICENSE\",\n        \"licenseText\": \"The MIT License (MIT)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014-present, Jon Schlinkert.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\\n\\n```html\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\\\"></script>\\n<script>\\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install imurmurhash\\n```\\n\\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\\n\\n```javascript\\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\\n```\\n\\nQuick Example\\n-------------\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Create the initial hash\\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\\n\\n// Incrementally add text\\nhashState.hash('more strings');\\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\\n\\n// All calls can be chained if desired\\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\\n\\n// Get a result\\nhashState.result();\\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\\n```\\n\\nFunctions\\n---------\\n\\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\\n...\\n\\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\\n```\\n\\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Do the whole string at once\\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\\n// 0x70529328\\n\\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\\nm.result();\\n// 0xbfc4f834\\nm.hash(' test string').result();\\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLicense (MIT)\\n-------------\\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal in\\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\\nsubject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The term \\\"Source Code\\\" means the preferred\\r\\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\\r\\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\\r\\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\\r\\nWork along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\\r\\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\\r\\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\\r\\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\\r\\nlong as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\\r\\nthe address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\\r\\nthe copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\\r\\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\\r\\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\\r\\nOriginal Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\\r\\nin this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\\r\\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\\r\\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\\r\\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\\r\\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\\r\\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\\r\\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\\r\\nLicense any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\\r\\nlicense.\\r\\n\\r\\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\\r\\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\\r\\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\\r\\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \\\"Attribution Notice.\\\" You must cause\\r\\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\\r\\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\\r\\nmodified the Original Work.\\r\\n\\r\\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\\r\\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\\r\\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms\\r\\nof this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights\\r\\nand patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding\\r\\nsentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \\\"AS IS\\\" BASIS\\r\\nand WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\\r\\nthe warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\r\\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.\\r\\nThis DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No\\r\\nlicense to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\\r\\n\\r\\n8) Limitation of Liability.

This limitation of liability shall not\\r\\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\\r\\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\\r\\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\\r\\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\\r\\n\\r\\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\\r\\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\\r\\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\\r\\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\\r\\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\\r\\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\\r\\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\\r\\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\\r\\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\\r\\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\\r\\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\\r\\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\\r\\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\\r\\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\\r\\npatent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\\r\\npatent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\\r\\nhardware.\\r\\n\\r\\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\\r\\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\\r\\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\\r\\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\\r\\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\\r\\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\\r\\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\\r\\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\\r\\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\\r\\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\\r\\n\\r\\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\\r\\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\\r\\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\\r\\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\\r\\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\\r\\nLicense.\\r\\n\\r\\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\\r\\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\\r\\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\\r\\nmake it enforceable.\\r\\n\\r\\n14) Definition of \\\"You\\\" in This License. \\\"You\\\" throughout this License, whether\\r\\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\\r\\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\\r\\nentities, \\\"You\\\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\\r\\nunder common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \\\"control\\\" means\\r\\n(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\\r\\nentity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\\r\\n(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\\r\\nentity.\\r\\n\\r\\n15) Right to Use.

These owners may\\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\\nefforts of others.\\n\\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\\nWork (the \\\"Affirmer\\\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\\n\\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\\\"Copyright and\\nRelated Rights\\\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\nto, the following:\\n\\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n  and translate a Work;\\n\\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n\\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\\n  depicted in a Work;\\n\\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\\n\\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n  a Work;\\n\\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n\\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\\n\\n2.

Refer to documentation below.\\n\\nSolid App Router is a universal router for SolidJS that combines paradigms of React Router and Ember Router. Routes can be defined both in the JSX and as a JSON object for file-system based routing and supports Nested Routing.\\n\\nIt supports all Solid's SSR methods and has Solid's Transitions baked in, so use freely with Suspense, Resources, and Lazy components. Solid App Router also allows you to define a Data function that loads in parallel of the Routes to allow automatic fetch-as-you-render that removes client side request waterfalls.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n```sh\\n> npm i solid-app-router\\n```\\n\\nInstall then wrap your application with the Router component:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { render } from \\\"solid-js/web\\\";\\nimport { Router } from \\\"solid-app-router\\\";\\nimport App from \\\"./App\\\";\\n\\nrender(\\n  () => (\\n    <Router>\\n      <App />\\n    </Router>\\n  ),\\n  document.getElementById(\\\"app\\\")\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## JSX Based\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { lazy } from \\\"solid-js\\\";\\nimport { render } from \\\"solid-js/web\\\";\\nimport { Router, Routes, Route, Link } from \\\"solid-app-router\\\";\\n\\nconst Users = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users.js\\\"));\\nconst User = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id].js\\\"));\\nconst UserHome = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id]/index.js\\\"));\\nconst UserSettings = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id]/settings.js\\\"));\\nconst UserNotFound = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id]/[...all].js\\\"));\\nconst Home = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/index.js\\\"));\\nconst NotFound = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/[...all].js\\\"));\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <h1>Awesome Site</h1>\\n      <Link class=\\\"nav\\\" href=\\\"/\\\">\\n        Home\\n      </Link>\\n      <Link class=\\\"nav\\\" href=\\\"/users\\\">\\n        Users\\n      </Link>\\n      <Routes>\\n        <Route path=\\\"/users\\\" element={<Users />} />\\n        <Route path=\\\"/users/:id\\\" element={<User />}>\\n          <Route path=\\\"/\\\" element={<UserHome />} />\\n          <Route path=\\\"/settings\\\" element={<UserSettings />} />\\n          <Route path=\\\"/*all\\\" element={<UserNotFound />} />\\n        </Route>\\n        <Route path=\\\"/\\\" element={<Home />} />\\n        <Route path=\\\"/*all\\\" element={<NotFound />} />\\n      </Routes>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nrender(\\n  () => (\\n    <Router>\\n      <App />\\n    </Router>\\n  ),\\n  document.getElementById(\\\"app\\\")\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## Config Based\\n\\nGreat for filesystem based routing:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { lazy } from \\\"solid-js\\\";\\nimport { render } from \\\"solid-js/web\\\";\\nimport { Router, useRoutes, Link } from \\\"solid-app-router\\\";\\n\\nconst routes = [\\n  {\\n    path: \\\"/users\\\",\\n    component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users.js\\\"))\\n  },\\n  {\\n    path: \\\"/users/:id\\\",\\n    component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id].js\\\")),\\n    children: [\\n      { path: \\\"/\\\", component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id]/index.js\\\")) },\\n      { path: \\\"/settings\\\", component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id]/settings.js\\\")) },\\n      { path: \\\"/*all\\\", component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id]/[...all].js\\\")) }\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  {\\n    path: \\\"/\\\",\\n    component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/index.js\\\"))\\n  },\\n  {\\n    path: \\\"/*all\\\",\\n    component: lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/[...all].js\\\"))\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  const Routes = useRoutes(routes);\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <h1>Awesome Site</h1>\\n      <Link class=\\\"nav\\\" href=\\\"/\\\">\\n        Home\\n      </Link>\\n      <Link class=\\\"nav\\\" href=\\\"/users\\\">\\n        Users\\n      </Link>\\n      <Routes />\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nrender(\\n  () => (\\n    <Router>\\n      <App />\\n    </Router>\\n  ),\\n  document.getElementById(\\\"app\\\")\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## Creating Links\\n\\nSolid App Router provides `<Link>` component to provides links in your application. By default all Routes and Links are relative to the parent that created them.\\n\\nSolid App Router provides a `<NavLink>` component that applies the `active` class when the current route matches its path. It has an `end` prop to indicate if it is the end of the path.\\n\\nSolid App Router also has a `<Navigate>` component useful for inlining redirects.\\n\\nThese Components all use `href` to define the path.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<>\\n  <NavLink href=\\\"/\\\" end>\\n    Home\\n  </NavLink>\\n  <NavLink href=\\\"/about\\\">About</NavLink>\\n  <NavLink href=\\\"/other\\\">Other</NavLink>\\n</>\\n```\\n\\nThere are a few special properties that can be applied to links to add additional behavior.\\n\\n`noScroll` - This prevents default behavior of scrolling to top navigation.\\n`replace` - This will replace history instead of pushing it.\\n`state` - This will add the state to the browser history. It must be serializable.\\n\\nIf you have a same domain link that you want the router not to handle use `rel=\\\"external\\\"`\\n\\n## Router Primitives\\n\\nSolid App Router provides a number of primitives that read off the Router and Route context.\\n\\n### useParams\\n\\nRetrieves an object containing the route path parameters as defined in the Route.\\n\\n```js\\nconst params = useParams();\\n\\n// fetch user based on the id path parameter\\nconst [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser);\\n```\\n\\n### useNavigate\\n\\nRetrieves method to do navigation. The method accepts a path to navigate to and an optional object with the following options:\\n\\n- resolve (_boolean_, default `true`): resolve the path against the current route\\n- replace (_boolean_, default `false`): replace the history entry\\n- scroll (_boolean_, default `true`): scroll to top after navigation\\n- state (_any_, default `undefined`): pass custom state to `location.state`\\n\\n__Note:__ The state is serialized using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) which does not support all object types.\\n\\n```js\\nconst navigate = useNavigate();\\n\\nif (unauthorized) {\\n  navigate(\\\"/login\\\", { replace: true });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### useLocation\\n\\nRetrieves reactive `location` object useful for getting things like `pathname`\\n\\n```js\\nconst location = useLocation();\\n\\nconst pathname = createMemo(() => parsePath(location.pathname));\\n```\\n\\n### useSearchParams\\n\\nRetrieves a tuple containing a reactive object to read the current location's query parameters and a method to update them. The object is a proxy so you must access properties to subscribe to reactive updates. Note values will be strings and property names will retain their casing.\\n\\nThe setter method accepts an object whos entries will be merged into the current query string. Values `''`, `undefined` and `null` will remove the key from the resulting query string. Updates will behave just like a navigation and the setter accepts the same optional second parameter as `navigate` and auto-scrolling is disabled by default.\\n\\n```js\\nconst [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();\\n\\nreturn (\\n  <div>\\n    <span>Page: {searchParams.page}</span>\\n    <button onClick={() => setSearchParams({ page: searchParams.page + 1 })}>Next Page</button>\\n  </div>\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### useIsRouting\\n\\nRetrieves signal that indicates whether the route is currently in a Transition. Useful for showing stale/pending state when the route resolution is Suspended during concurrent rendering.\\n\\n```js\\nconst isRouting = useIsRouting();\\n\\nreturn (\\n  <div classList={{ \\\"grey-out\\\": isRouting() }}>\\n    <MyAwesomeConent />\\n  </div>\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### useRouteData\\n\\nRetrieves the return value from the data function.\\n\\n> In previous versions you could use numbers to access parent data. This is no longer supported. Instead the data functions themselves receive the parent data that you can expose through the specific nested routes data.\\n\\n```js\\nconst user = useRouteData();\\n\\nreturn <h1>{user().name}</h1>;\\n```\\n\\n### useMatch\\n\\n`useMatch` takes an accessor that returns the path and creates a Memo that returns match information if the current path matches the provided path. Useful for determining if a given path matches the current route.\\n\\n```js\\nconst match = useMatch(() => props.href);\\n\\nreturn <div classList={{ active: Boolean(match()) }} />;\\n```\\n\\n### useRoutes\\n\\nUsed to define routes via a config object instead of JSX. See `Config Based` above.\\n\\n## Nested Routing\\n\\nYou can define long paths on your routes and they are handle independently. But with nested Routing we can automatically set up nested layouts. Need to share a header between pages, nest it as children. You can see examples above.\\n\\nHowever, while `<Routes>` serve as the entry point for the navigation, for nested routes you need to indicate where the nested route should be inserted. You use the `<Outlet>` component to do that.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { Outlet, useRouteData } from \\\"solid-app-router\\\";\\n\\nfunction User() {\\n  const user = useRouteData();\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <h1>{user()?.name}</h1>\\n      {/* Insert nested Route Here */}\\n      <Outlet />\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Data Functions\\n\\nData functions are designed to load in parallel to your lazy loaded routes. They get bundled with your main bundle allowing your page code to be separated and loaded on demand in parallel. You can pass in the `data` prop to your Route definition.\\n\\n```js\\nimport { lazy } from \\\"solid-js\\\";\\nimport { Route } from \\\"solid-app-router\\\";\\nimport UserData from \\\"./pages/users/[id].data.js\\\";\\n\\nconst User = lazy(() => import(\\\"/pages/users/[id].js\\\"));\\n\\n// In the Route definition\\n<Route path=\\\"/users/:id\\\" element={<User />} data={UserData} />;\\n```\\n\\n```js\\n// pages/users/[id].data.js\\nimport { createResource } from \\\"solid-js\\\";\\n\\nfunction fetchUser(userId) {\\n  /* fetching logic */\\n}\\n\\nexport default function UserData({ params, location, navigate, data }) {\\n  const [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser);\\n\\n  return user;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nData function should create reactive values and return synchronously so that they can be accessed in the case that the route loads before the data does.\",\n        \"name\": \"solid-app-router\",\n        \"version\": \"0.3.2\"\n    },\n    \"solid-js@1.3.13\": {\n        \"licenses\": \"MIT\",\n        \"repository\": \"https://github.com/solidjs/solid\",\n        \"publisher\": \"Ryan Carniato\",\n        \"path\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/solid-js\",\n        \"licenseFile\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/solid-js/LICENSE\",\n        \"licenseText\": \"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2016-2019 Ryan Carniato\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It uses LRU/LFU (LRFU) expiration to retain referenced data, and then once data has been inactive, it uses weak references (and finalization registry) to allow GC to remove the cached data as part of the normal GC cycles, but still continue to provide cached access to the data as long as it still resides in memory and hasn't been collected. This provides the best of modern expiration strategies combined with optimal GC interaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a typical GC'ed VM, objects may continue to exist in memory long after they are no longer (strongly) referenced, but using a weak-referencing cached, we allow the GC to collect such data, but the cache can return this data up until the point it is garbaged collected, ensuring much more efficient use of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can also be used to ensure a single object identity per key. By storing an object in the cache for a given key, we can check the cache whenever we need that object, and before recreating it, thereby giving us the means to ensure we also use the same object for a given key as long as it still exists in memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project is tested and run NodeJS and Deno (requires NodeJS v14.10 or higher or Node v13.0 with --harmony-weak-ref flag).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Setup\\r\\n\\r\\nInstall with (NPM):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nnpm i weak-lru-cache\\r\\n```\\r\\nAnd `import` or `require` it to access the constructor:\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport { WeakLRUCache } from 'weak-lru-cache';\\r\\n\\r\\nlet myCache = new WeakLRUCache();\\r\\nmyValue.setValue('key', { greeting: 'hello world' });\\r\\nmyValue.getValue('key') -> return the object above as long as it is still cached\\r\\n```\\r\\nOr in Deno, import directly from the [`weakcache` deno.land package](https://deno.land/x/weakcache):\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport { WeakLRUCache } from 'https://deno.land/x/weakcache/index.js';\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WeakLRUCache` class extends the native `Map` class and also includes the following methods, which are the primary intended interactions with the cache:\\r\\n\\r\\n### getValue(key)\\r\\nGets the value referenced by the given key and returns it. If the value is no longer cached, will return undefined. \\r\\n\\r\\n### setValue(key, value, expirationPriority?)\\r\\nSets or inserts the value into the cache, with the given key. This will create a new cache entry to reference your provided value. This also returns the cache entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `key` can be any JS value.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the `value` is an object, it will be stored in the cache, until it expires (as determined by the LRFU expiration policy), *and* is garbage collected. If you provide a primitive value (string, number, boolean, null, etc.), this can not be weakly referenced, so the value will still be stored in the LRFU cache, but once it expires, it will immediately be removed, rather than waiting for GC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `expirationPriority` is an optional directive indicating how quickly the cache entry should expire. A higher value will indicate the entry should expire sooner. This can be used to help limit the amount of memory used by cache if you are loading large objects. Using the default cache size, and entries with varied expirationPriority values, the expiration cache will typically hold a sum of about 100,000 of the expirationPriority values. This means that if you wanted to have a cache to stay around or under 100MB, you could provide the size, divided by 1000 (or using `>> 10` is much faster), as the expirationPriority:\\r\\n```\\r\\nmyCache.setValue('key', bigObject, sizeOfObject >> 10);\\r\\n```\\r\\nThe `expirationPriority` can also be set to `-1` that the value should be `pinned` in memory and never expire, until the entry has been changed (with a positive `expirationPriority`).\\r\\n\\r\\n## `WeakLRUCache(options)` Constructor\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WeakLRUCache` constructor supports an optional `options` object parameter that allows specific configuration and cache tuning. The following properties (all optional) can be defined on the `options` object:\\r\\n\\r\\n### cacheSize\\r\\nThis indicates the number of entries to allocate in the cache. This defaults to 32,768, and the maximum allowed value is 16,777,216.\\r\\n\\r\\n### expirer\\r\\nBy default there is a single shared expiration cache, that is a single instance of `LRFUExpirer`. However, you can define your own expiration cache or create separate instances of LRFUExpirer. Generally using a (the default) single instance is preferable since it naturally gives higher priority/recency to more heavily used caches, and allows lesser used caches to expire more of their entries.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also set this to `false` to indicate that no LRU/LRFU cache should be used and the cache should rely entirely on weak-references.\\r\\n\\r\\n### deferRegister\\r\\nThis flag can be set to true to save key and cache information so that it can defer the finalization registration. This tends to be slightly faster for caches that are more heavily dominated by lots of entry replacements (multiple setValue calls to same entries before they expire). However, for (what is generally considered more typical) usage more dominated by setting values and getting them until they expire, the default setting will probably be faster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Using Cache Entries\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WeakLRUCache` class extends the native `Map` class, and consequently, all the standard Map methods are available. As a Map, all the values are cache entries, which are typically `WeakRef` objects that hold a reference to the cached value, along with retention information. This means that the `get(key)` differs from `getValue(key)` in that it returns the cache entry, which references the value, rather than the value itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cache entries also can contain metadata about the entry, including information about the cache entries position in the LRFU cache that informs when it will expire. However, you can also set your own properties on the cache entry to store you own metadata. This will be retained until the entry is removed/collected.\\r\\n\\r\\n## License\\r\\n\\r\\nMIT\",\n        \"name\": \"weak-lru-cache\",\n        \"version\": \"1.2.2\"\n    },\n    \"webidl-conversions@4.0.2\": {\n        \"licenses\": \"BSD-2-Clause\",\n        \"repository\": \"https://github.com/jsdom/webidl-conversions\",\n        \"publisher\": \"Domenic Denicola\",\n        \"email\": \"d@domenic.me\",\n        \"url\": \"https://domenic.me/\",\n        \"path\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/webidl-conversions\",\n        \"licenseFile\": \"/home/runner/work/WAMuP/WAMuP/node_modules/webidl-conversions/LICENSE.md\",\n        \"licenseText\": \"# The BSD 2-Clause License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014, Domenic Denicola\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\\n\\n1.
